Read text and find faces on newspaper images using pillow, tesseract, and opencv

Search for certain text across many images of newspaper pages, and where the 
target text is found, return a contact sheet of images of any
faces found on that page.

Use pillow for image processing, tesseract for optical character recoginition,
and opencv for facial recognition.

University of Michigan
Python Project: pillow, tesseract, and opencv
Final Project Solution

The project was completed using Jupyter Notebooks.
I have included the Jupyter Notebook file, but I worked on the project locally
so I included the solution as a Python file with a requirements.txt.

Unfortunately, the image files are too large to upload to Github.
The program results on the provided images can be viewed in the HTML file of
the Jupyter Notebooks solution.
